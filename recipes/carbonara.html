    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Indulge in the rich, creamy simplicity of a traditional Roman carbonara. This beloved pasta dish combines al dente spaghetti with crispy pancetta, tossed in a velvety sauce made from eggs, Parmesan, and black pepper—no cream, no shortcuts. The heat of the pasta gently cooks the egg mixture, creating a silky coating that clings to every strand. Perfectly balanced between salty, savory, and peppery, carbonara is Italian comfort food at its finest.</p>
