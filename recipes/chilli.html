        <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>400g (14 oz) canned diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>400g (14 oz) canned kidney beans, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>400g (14 oz) canned black beans, drained and rinsed (optional but adds texture)</li>
        <li>1 cup beef stock or water</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 tbsp chili powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>½ tsp cayenne pepper (optional, for extra heat)</li>
        <li>1½ tsp salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>½ tsp black pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar (to balance acidity)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Heat The Oil</strong><p>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat 2 tbsp olive oil over medium heat.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Sauté the aromatics</strong><p>Add diced onion and cook for 3–4 minutes until softened.
Stir in minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds until fragrant.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Brown the beef</strong><p>Add the ground beef, breaking it apart with a spoon. Cook until browned (about 5–7 minutes). Drain excess fat if necessary.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Add bell pepper and tomato paste</strong><p>Stir in diced red bell pepper and tomato paste. Cook for 2–3 minutes to slightly caramelize the paste and soften the pepper.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Add spices</strong><p>Sprinkle in chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, oregano, cayenne (optional), salt, pepper, and sugar. Stir to evenly coat the beef and vegetables in the spices.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Add tomatoes, beans, and stock</strong><p>Pour in the diced tomatoes, kidney beans, black beans (if using), and beef stock. Stir to combine everything.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Simmer</strong><p>Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover partially and simmer for 30–45 minutes, stirring occasionally. The longer it simmers, the richer the flavor.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Adjust seasoning</strong><p>Taste and adjust salt, pepper, or spices as needed. If it's too thick, add a splash of water or stock. If too thin, simmer uncovered a little longer.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Serve and top</strong><p>Ladle into bowls and top with your favorite toppings: cheddar cheese, sour cream, green onions, jalapeños, or corn chips.</p></li>
